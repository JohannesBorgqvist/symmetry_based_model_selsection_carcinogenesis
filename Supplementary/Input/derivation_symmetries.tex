The aim is to find the symmetries of three models predicting risk profiles over time. The focus of the article is the following three models

\begin{align}
R(t)&=Ae^{\alpha t},\label{eq:exp}\\
R(t)&=At^{\gamma},\label{eq:power_law}\\
R(t)&=\dfrac{A}{e^{e^{-\alpha(t-\tau)}}-1}.\label{eq:mixed}
\end{align}


The three models originally presented in \cite{Palmer1883} will be referred to as the exponential model in \eqref{eq:exp}, the power law model in \eqref{eq:power_law} and the mixed model in \eqref{eq:mixed}.
