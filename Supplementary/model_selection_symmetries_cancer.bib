   abstract = {Understanding the risk factors of carcinogenesis is a major goal of biomedical research. Historically, the focus has been on the role of somatic mutations, and the reason for cancer typically occurring late in life is predominantly attributed to a gradual accumulation of such mutations. We challenge that view and propose that the decline of the immune system is the primary reason why cancer is an age-related disease. The immunological model featured here captures risk profiles for many cancer types and infectious diseases, suggesting that therapies reversing T cell exhaustion or restoring T cell production will be promising avenues of treatment.For many cancer types, incidence rises rapidly with age as an apparent power law, supporting the idea that cancer is caused by a gradual accumulation of genetic mutations. Similarly, the incidence of many infectious diseases strongly increases with age. Here, combining data from immunology and epidemiology, we show that many of these dramatic age-related increases in incidence can be modeled based on immune system decline, rather than mutation accumulation. In humans, the thymus atrophies from infancy, resulting in an exponential decline in T cell production with a half-life of ~16 years, which we use as the basis for a minimal mathematical model of disease incidence. Our model outperforms the power law model with the same number of fitting parameters in describing cancer incidence data across a wide spectrum of different cancers, and provides excellent fits to infectious disease data. This framework provides mechanistic insight into cancer emergence, suggesting that age-related decline in T cell output is a major risk factor.},

@article{Simpson2021,
   abstract = {Sigmoid growth models, such as the logistic, Gompertz and Richards models, are widely used to study population dynamics ranging from microscopic populations of cancer cells, to continental-scale human populations. Fundamental questions about model selection and parameter estimation are critical if these models are to be used to make practical inferences. However, the question of parameter identifiability  whether a data set contains sufficient information to give unique or sufficiently precise parameter estimates  is often overlooked. We use a profile-likelihood approach to explore practical parameter identifiability using data describing the re-growth of hard coral. With this approach, we explore the relationship between parameter identifiability and model misspecification, finding that the logistic growth model does not suffer identifiability issues for the type of data we consider whereas the Gompertz and Richards models encounter practical non-identifiability issues. This analysis of parameter identifiability and model selection is important because different growth models are used within areas of the biological modelling literature without necessarily considering whether parameters are identifiable, or checking statistical assumptions underlying model adequacy. Standard practices that do not consider parameter identifiability can lead to unreliable or imprecise parameter estimates and potentially misleading mechanistic interpretations. While tools developed here focus on three standard sigmoid growth models only, our theoretical developments are applicable to any sigmoid growth model and any relevant data set. MATLAB implementations of all software are available on GitHub.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.},
