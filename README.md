# Symmetry based model selection in the context of carcinogenesis

Welcome to the github-repositry *symmetry\_based_model\_selsection\_carcinogenesis*! This project is entirely written in Python meaning that it is open-source, and our aim is that the results in the article (**Reference to future article**) should be reproducable. Let's describe the project and all the relevant packages! 

## Description of the project
One of the greatest challenges in mathematical biology is that of model selection. Given some type of experimental data, it is often possible for the modeller to construct *multiple candidate models* that describe the same data. In the context of *mechanistic modelling* often relying on differential equations, the biological assumptions about the mechanism of the system of interest are encoded in the mathematical equations. This means that each of the candidate models encode a specific biological hypothesis, and by fitting the models to data the modeller would solve a so called *model selection problem*:<br>

*Pick the model that best fits the data.*<br>



In our article, we propose a new criteria for model selection succintly formulated as follows:<br>

"*Select the model whose fit is invariant under transformations by its symmetries.*"
