This folder contains csv-files with the relevant information from the model fitting. The names of all files contain information about which dataset that has been used (myeloma, colon cancer or *Chronic Myeloid Leukemia* (CML)), which model that is fitted to the data (the PLM or the IM) and which type of model fitting that has been used (ODR or LS). Currently, ODR is done to fit the models to the data, but the user can go into the script with relative path "../Code/symmetry\_analysis\_PLM\_vs\_IM.py" and easily re-do this analysis by using Least Squares (LS) instead.
